\chapter{Preface}
Subsystem and quantum embedding approaches are currently among the most quickly developing
methods in quantum chemistry. This is mostly due to their computational efficiency
and their easy interpretability in terms of intuitive, well-defined chemical subunits.
While the general idea of combining electronic-structure methods of different or the same
types for separate fragments is maybe straightforward, the practical execution of such
calculations can be a frustrating experience. The background is that such a combination
may require interfacing of different codes with limited interoperability through text files.
This strategy can be very successful, but usually also causes an overhead of work for the specific
interfaces needed. Moreover, it is vulnerable to (even slight) changes in the input/output
structure or working principles of the original programs. Even if all technical challenges
are dealt with, inexperienced users may find it hard to choose the optimum embedding approach
for a problem at hand, since comparison of different schemes can be very difficult.\\
\\
This was our motivation for developing a new quantum chemistry code that should give access
to a wide variety of quantum embedding approaches. This should allow for easy comparisons
of embedding schemes, as \serenity is written with a subsystem structure in mind right from
the beginning. Hence, it includes several possibilities for embedding calculations with
different ingredients. Its modular structure should make it easily extensible to upcoming
embedding features. As an open-source project, it may be tailored to user-specific requirements
whenever desired.\\
\\
The following manual shows how to use \serenity as a standalone program. Its usage as a
library is best explained through the source code (detailed manual
information may follow at a later point).


\chapter{Install}
Please read the following instructions carefully, these instructions can also be found in the \texttt{README.md} distributed with
the source code.

\section{Prerequisites}
The code has been tested and compiled on Linux with GCC/G++
(Versions 7 and newer) and Clang (Versions 8 and newer)
compilation with other compilers such as ICC should be
possible on Linux.\\
\\
Furthermore, the code has been compiled on macOS using Clang
but may experience problems depending on the CPU architecture.
Compilation with GCC on macOS should most likely also be possible.\\
\\
Compilation on and for Windows is not supported at the moment.
\\
The following programs/libraries must be available on your system:
\begin{itemize}
 \item CMake (Version $>=$ 3.12)
 \item Boost (for package managers: including boost-devel)
 \item OpenMP
 \item Eigen3
 \item HDF5 (Version $>=$ 1.10.1; including header files and cmake files)
 \item A recent GMP version, including C++ support (for libint2)
 \item The standard GNU tool chain (make, tar, autoconf, libtool)
\end{itemize}
The following libraries will be automatically downloaded and installed together
with \serenity (unless \texttt{SERENITY\_DOWNLOAD\_DEPENDENCIES=OFF} is set):
\begin{itemize}
 \item libint2 (Version 2.2.0-beta3, pre-configured and hosted at: \url{https://thclab.uni-muenster.de/serenity/libint})
 \item libecpint (The Serenity version is forked to: \url{https://github.com/qcserenity/libecpint})
 \item libxc (v6.1.0 from \url{https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc})
 \item xcfun (The Serenity verison is forked to: \url{https://github.com/qcserenity/xcfun})
 \item GTest (Google Test and Google Mock)
\end{itemize}
The following libraries are optional and needed for additional features:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Intel MKL (for SMP parallel Eigen3 eigenvalue solvers)
 \item Doxygen (for the documentation)
 \item Python-devel (for the python wrapper)
 \item pybind11 (for the python wrapper)
 \item laplace-minimax (\url{https://github.com/bhelmichparis/laplace-minimax.git})
\end{itemize}

\section{Install Using CMake and Make}

Extract or pull the source code, then create a build directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
cd serenity
mkdir build
cd build
\end{lstlisting}
Then run cmake:
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake ..
\end{lstlisting}
To compile Serenity for your specific CPU architecture, you can add:
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake -DSERENITY_MARCH=native ..
\end{lstlisting}
(If the build folder is not located inside the main directory of \textsc{Serenity}
please adapt the path accordingly.)

Finally run make and make install to build the program:
\begin{lstlisting}
make
\end{lstlisting}
Please source serenity.sh located in the main folder to set all necessary environment
variables:
\begin{lstlisting}
cd ..
source serenity.sh
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Install Including Python Interface}
In order to activate the compilation of a Python interface to the code
a flag can be set as follows
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake -DSERENITY_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ..
\end{lstlisting}
additionally this and other flags can be toggled using `ccmake`
\begin{lstlisting}
ccmake ..
\end{lstlisting}
The wrapper will be build for the Python version that CMake finds first
In order to point CMake to a specific version of Python the following
option can be used:
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 ..
\end{lstlisting}
The wrapper is shipped in form of a shared library (serenipy.so).
In order for Python to find this package the library folder has to be present
in the \texttt{PYTHONPATH} environment variable and the Serenity library has to be
present in a path searched by the system for shared libraries.
The latter is done when sourcing the \texttt{serenity.sh} script, the former requires
to un-comment one line in this file.
Afterwards the interface should importable as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
python3
import serenipy as spy
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Tests}
Serenity comes with a decent set of unittests in order to run them source
the \texttt{serenity.sh} script and run
\begin{lstlisting}
PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR/bin/serenity_tests
\end{lstlisting}
Please use the complete path, or else GTEST might run into problems.

The Python wrapper comes with its own set of tests, these can be run using
\begin{lstlisting}
python -m unittest discover PATH_TO_SERENITY/src/python/tests
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Documentation}
After configuring the project using CMake it is possible to create the documentation
using:
\begin{lstlisting}
make doc
\end{lstlisting}
Then you can open up the doc/html/index.html in a browser.
The python wrapper is not featured inside the documentation.
Its documentation is available via pythons help() function,
which displays the build-in doc-strings.

\chapter{Text Input}

The input of \serenity has two main types of sections, the \ttt{system} blocks and the \ttt{task} blocks.
A chart depicting how \serenity handles input can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:input}.
While the chart is already quite technical, it displays how to read the sectioned input.
Starting from the right, the main job of the program is to run tasks in a certain order.
These tasks can be related \textit{via} the systems they use, \textit{i.e.} a \ttt{MP2Task} will used
orbital data from a previous \ttt{SCFTask} if both of them are working with the same system.
Accordingly, the first part of the input has to be the system definitions which is followed by
a list of tasks to complete with these systems.
In a minimal case, the systems are just a geometry and a set of settings (such as charge, spin, basis set, and so on).
During the run these systems will be populated with more (calculated) data, such as orbitals, energies and electron densities.
This additional data can also be read from previous runs (see the following section).
Any feature that \serenity has is implemented as a task (or a part of a task).
For a list of available features/tasks, see Section~\ref{sec:tasks}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:input}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{./figs/SerenityInput.pdf}
\caption{Input flow of \serenity.}
\end{figure}\\
As stated above, the text input of \serenity is structured into blocks containing the keywords.
A keyword consists of a name and a value and is always given inside of a block.
Each keyword-value pair has to be given in one separate line.
As for the blocks, there are two main types, those are \ttt{system} and \ttt{task}.
A block in the {\serenity} text input is started by a \ttt{+<blockname>} and ended with a
\ttt{-<blockname>}.
The main blocks of a simple input might thus look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
 name water
 geometry ./water.xyz
 method dft
 +dft
  functional PBE
 -dft
-system

+task scf
  system water
-task
\end{lstlisting}
While there are many settings and thus many keywords, all of them are defaulted, and
each run of the program will create a file containing all settings (even the default ones)
for restart purposes.\\
The input accepts comments just like shell scripts.
Thus everything preceded  by a hash is not parsed.
This holds for entire lines but also for parts of a line.
\begin{lstlisting}
# not parsed
+system # also not parsed
 name test
 geometry test.xyz
 # you guessed it, this is also not parsed
-system
\end{lstlisting}
The entire input (with the exception of system names and path names) is case-insensitive.
Keywords could thus look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
  gradients true
  funcTIONAL PbE0
  maxCycles 123
  NaMe water # note that the value of name is case sensitive
\end{lstlisting}
A list of values for a keyword can be parsed by enclosing them into curly brackets:
\begin{lstlisting}
  orbitals {1 2 3 4}
\end{lstlisting}
A list of settings (keywords) inside the \ttt{system} and \ttt{task} blocks will be
presented in the following two sections.

\newpage
\section{Systems}\label{sec:system}
Each system is defined by one system block, a system block contains general keywords and can contain one layer of sub-blocks.
All relevant keywords are discussed in this section.
\subsection{General Keywords}\label{sec:system:general}
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
  +system
    name methyl
    geometry methyl.xyz
    method HF
    charge 0
    spin 1
  -system
 \end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
 \item [\texttt{name}]\hfill \\
   The system name.
 \item [\texttt{geometry}]\hfill \\
   The path to the geometry (.xyz). This or \ttt{load} has to be given.
   \item [\texttt{path}]\hfill \\
   The path to store HDF5 files.
   \item [\texttt{load}]\hfill \\
   The path to load HDF5 and settings files from. If this is given all other settings are replaced by the loaded settings. \serenity will search 
   for a directory with \ttt{name} at the given path.
   \item [\texttt{charge}]\hfill \\
   The charge of the system. Default is $0$.
   \item [\texttt{spin}]\hfill \\
   The spin of the system. Given as alpha spin electron excess. Default is $0$.
 \item [\texttt{scfmode}]\hfill \\
   The orbital mode of the SCF. Default is \ttt{RESTRICTED}. If \ttt{UNRESTRICTED} is chosen a unrestricted calculation is enforced.
  \item [\texttt{method}]\hfill \\
  The general electronic structure method for this system. By default \ttt{HF} (Hartree-Fock) is chosen. Other options are \ttt{DFT}.
\end{description}

The keywords given directly inside the system block and not within one of the nested blocks are presented
in this section.\\
A regular system will need both the \ttt{geometry} and also the \ttt{name} keyword.
Further keywords can be given if their values need to differ from the defaults.
A loaded system only needs the \ttt{load} keyword and a \ttt{name}.
All other keywords will be deduced from the stored settings.

\subsection{SCF Block}\label{sec:system:scf}
All settings available pertaining the SCF and its convergence are given in this sub-block of the system block.
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
  +system
    name methyl
    geometry methyl.xyz
    method HF
    charge 0
    spin 1
    +scf
      maxCycles 100
      damping dynamic
    -scf
  -system
 \end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
 \item [\texttt{initialguess}]\hfill \\
   The initial guess for the electronic structure. Possible options are:\\
   \ttt{HCORE}: $h_{core}$ guess, i.e. ignoring electron-electron interactions.\\
   \ttt{EHT}: extended Hueckel theory guess.\\
   \ttt{ATOM\_DENS}: guess of combined atomic densities (minimal basis).\\
   \ttt{ATOM\_SCF}: similar to \ttt{ATOM\_DENS}, combined atomic densities (def2-QZVP basis).\\
   \ttt{ATOM\_SCF\_INPLACE}: generate the atomic densities on the fly with atom-wise SCFs.\\
   \ttt{SAP}: superposition of atomic potentials.\\
   The default is \ttt{ATOM\_SCF}. For atoms using effective core potentials, the \ttt{ATOM\_SCF\_INPLACE}
   guess is used as the default.
 \item [\texttt{damping}]\hfill \\
   The mode of damping of the new Fock matrix with the last one during the SCF.\\
   \ttt{NONE}: no damping.\\
   \ttt{SERIES}: damping value decreases in each step.\\
   \ttt{STATIC}: static damping value.\\
   \ttt{DYNAMIC}: dynamic damping value adjustment (see Ref.~\cite{cances2000can}).\\
   The default is \ttt{SERIES}.
   \item [\texttt{maxCycles}]\hfill \\
   Maximum number of SCF cycles. Default is $100$.
   \item [\texttt{energyThreshold}]\hfill \\
   Convergence criterion for the energy. Default is 5e-8.
   \item [\texttt{rmsdThreshold}]\hfill \\
   Convergence criterion for the density matrix. Default is 1e-8.
  \item [\texttt{diisThreshold}]\hfill \\
   The convergence criterion for the DIIS ([F,P]) error. Default is 5e-7.
   \item [\texttt{minimumLevelshift}]\hfill \\
   Minimum diagonal level-shift to be used. Default is $0.0$. Typical values are $0.3$ or $0.1$. Setting this to values larger than $0$ will
   help non-converging SCF procedures. However, it increases the number of iterations.
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Advanced Keywords}
\begin{description}
    \item [\texttt{writeRestart}]\hfill \\
    Interval to write checkpoints during SCF. Default is $5$.
   \item [\texttt{seriesDampingStart}]\hfill \\
    Start value for the series damping. Default is $0.7$.
    \item [\texttt{seriesDampingEnd}]\hfill \\
    End value for the series damping. Default is $0.2$.
    \item [\texttt{seriesDampingStep}]\hfill \\
    Increment value for the series damping. Default is $0.05$.
    \item [\texttt{seriesDampingStart}]\hfill \\
    Start value for the series damping. Default is $0.7$.
    \item [\texttt{seriesDampingInitialSteps}]\hfill \\
    Number of initial steps without increment. Default is $2$.
    \item [\texttt{staticDampingFactor}]\hfill \\
    Damping value for the static damping. Default is $0.7$.
    \item [\texttt{endDampErr}]\hfill \\
    $\text{[F,P]}$ value at which the damping ends. Default is $0.05$.
    If the SCF has problems converging it may help to stop the damping at a lower error. However, this can
    increase the number of SCF iterations needed significantly.
    \item [\texttt{diisStartError}]\hfill \\
    $\text{[F,P]}$ value at which the DIIS starts. Default is $0.05$.
    \item [\texttt{diisMaxStore}]\hfill \\
    The number of Fock Matrices stored int the DIIS. Default is $10$. If oscillations in the SCF occur, it can
    help to change this number. Typical values are between $5$ and $15$.
    \item [\texttt{useLevelshift}]\hfill \\
    Use a level-shift for the diagonal elements of the virtual--virtual Fock matrix block. Default is \ttt{true}.
    \item [\texttt{useOffDiagLevelshift}]\hfill \\
    Use a scaling for the virtual--occupied Fock matrix block. Default is \ttt{false}.
    \item [\texttt{canOrthThreshold}]\hfill \\
    Minimum eigenvalue of the overlap matrix to be tolerated. Default is 1e-7. This eliminates linear dependencies
    in the basis set. The default threshold is quite conservative. Linear dependencies can lead to numerical instability
    for procedures that depend explicitly on the orbital coefficients, e.g. coupled cluster.
    \item [\texttt{useADIIS}]\hfill \\
    Use the A-DIIS\cite{hu2010} procedure at the beginning of the SCF. Default is \ttt{false}. This interpolation scheme
    includes an energy minimization criterion into the Fock-matrix update. The A-DIIS is supposed to be stable even for a
    bad initial guess. The A-DIIS is turned off automatically, when the DIIS procedure starts.
 \end{description}

\subsection{Basis Block}\label{sec:system:basis}
All settings available pertaining the usage and generation of basis sets.
The basis sets can be found in \texttt{data/basis}. These are not exclusive. Any folder with \textsc{Turbomole}
style basis sets can be given and every file can be added to it, given that the file names are spelled in
uppercase.

\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
  +system
    name methyl
    geometry methyl.xyz
    method HF
    charge 0
    spin 1
    +basis
      label def2-SVP
    -basis
  -system
 \end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
 \item [\texttt{label}]\hfill \\
 Basis set name. \serenity will search for a file with the given label in uppercase at the \ttt{basisLibPath}. Default is \ttt{6-31GS}.

\end{description}
\subsubsection{Advanced Keywords}
\begin{description}
    \item [\texttt{makeSphericalBasis}]\hfill \\
    Use spherical harmonics basis. Default is \ttt{true}. If \ttt{false}, a Cartesian basis set is constructed.
    \item [\texttt{basisLibPath}]\hfill \\
    Basis set file location (default taken from environment variable).
    \item [\texttt{auxJLabel}]\hfill \\
    Auxiliary basis set name for Coulomb interactions (RI). Default is \ttt{RI\_J\_Weigend}
    \item [\texttt{auxCLabel}]\hfill \\
    Auxiliary basis set name for Correlation interactions (RI). If none is given, \serenity will search for a
    basis-set file for the given basis with a filename \ttt{label}-RI-C.
    \item [\texttt{firstECP}]\hfill \\
    Atomic number threshold for the use of ECPs if available in the basis-set file. Default is $37$ (starting from the 5'th period).
    It is possible to manipulate/add the ECP definition to any basis-set file. For an example see the DEF2-SVP basis-set file.
    \item [\texttt{integralThreshold}]\hfill \\
    Threshold for the prescreening in integral evaluations. Default it is calculated as $1\cdot 10^{-8}/(3 M)$, where $M$ is
    the number of Cartesian basis functions.
    \item [\texttt{integralIncrementThresholdStart}]\hfill \\
    Initial integral prescreening threshold. Default is 1e-8.
    \item [\texttt{integralIncrementThresholdEnd}]\hfill \\
    Final integral prescreening threshold. Default it is equal to \texttt{integralThreshold}.
    \item [\texttt{incrementalSteps}]\hfill \\
    SCF-step interval to tighten the integral threshold by a factor of 100. Default is $5$.
    \item [\texttt{densityFitting}]\hfill \\
    The density fitting approach to be used. By default the \ttt{RI} approximation is used for the electron-electron
    Coulomb integrals. Furthermore, different approaches using the Cholesky decomposition can be chosen, namely the generic Cholesky decomposition \ttt{CD}, the atomic Cholesky decomposition \ttt{ACD} and the atomic-compact Cholesky decomposition \ttt{ACCD}. The full four center integrals may be used by selecting \ttt{NONE} for \ttt{densityFitting}. 
    \item [\texttt{cdThreshold}]\hfill\\
    Decomposition threshold for all Cholesky decomposition based methods. The default is \ttt{1e-6}.
    \item [\texttt{extendSphericalACDShells}]\hfill\\
    The scheme to generate complete spherical basis function products represented as a spherical function. \ttt{NONE} uses the pure product of the spherical basis functions. With the default setting \ttt{SIMPLE} a single additional basis function is added to account for missing contributions. Using \ttt{COMLETE} the full product is approximated.
    \item[\texttt{intCondition}]
    Threshold to determine whether a four center integral should be cached or not.
    The caching criterion is based on the number of primitive  functions entering each basis function and their angular
    momentum. In general, integrals over highly contracted basis functions with low angular momentum are more likely to
    be cached. By default \ttt{-1} (no integral caching is used). For small to medium sized molecules
    (\emph{e.g.} up to 3000 basis functions) a threshold of \ttt{4} gives a balanced speed/memory-usage. The larger the
    threshold the more selective will the integral caching be.
 \end{description}

    function if \ttt{BECKE} is chosen as \ttt{gridType}, see Ref.~\cite{beck1988}.
 \end{description}


\subsection{DFT Block}\label{sec:system:dft}
The \ttt{DFT} block contains all options pertaining only DFT calculations.
Note that changes in this block do not automatically enable the \ttt{method dft}
keyword from the general system settings.
This keyword is still required in order to use \ttt{DFT} instead of the default \ttt{HF}.

\subsection{PCM Block}\label{sec:system:pcm}

The PCM block contains all options for implicit solvent models. Note that this block can
be used not only in the system definition but in the task definition, too. If set for
a system, the PCM settings will apply to the system. For tasks the PCM settings will apply
to the task, which may affect multiple systems. For the embedding step of FDE-type
calculations any system-specific PCM-settings are ignored and only the task specific settings
are applied.

GEPOL-type\cite{Pascual-Ahuir1987} (solvent-excluded and solvent-accessible-surface) and
a Delley-type\cite{Delley2006} surface are available. Note, that the GEPOL-type surfaces
show discontinuities at the intersection between spheres surrounding atoms. The Delley-type
surface does not show these problems.

The parameters for the tabulated solvents are taken from
\url{{https://pcmsolver.readthedocs.io}}.
Note that this data is provided for convenience and may contain errors.

A detailed description of the implementation of the Delley-type surface is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:MolcSurface}.
Analytical gradients are implemented for single systems and CPCM only.

For single systems the calculation of a cavity formation energy using the Pierotti--Claverie scaled particle
theory formula\cite{langlet1988improvements} is possible. For the calculation of this energy a Van-der-Waals
type surface (DELLEY-type surface, Van-der-Waals-radii) is used.


\subsubsection{Example Input}

    spin 0
    +pcm 
      use true
      solverType CPCM 
      solvent ETHANOL
    -pcm 
  -system
 \end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
  \item [\texttt{use}]\hfill \\
  If true, the implicit solvent model is used. The default is \ttt{false}.
 \item [\texttt{solverType}]\hfill \\
 The type of solver continuum model to be used. \ttt{CPCM} selects the continuum-like PCM and 
 \ttt{IEFPCM} selects the integral equation formalism variant of PCM. \ttt{CPCM} is the default.
 \item [\texttt{solvent}]\hfill \\
 Select a predefined and tabulated solvent. The default is \ttt{WATER}. All options are given in the table below.
 The manual solvent definition can be triggered by selecting \ttt{EXPLICIT} as the solvent. If done so, the keywords 
 \ttt{eps} (static permittivity) and \ttt{probeRadius} (solvent probe radius) have to be set manually.
 \item [\texttt{cavityFormation}]\hfill \\
 Enable the calculation of a cavity formation energy using scaled particle theory. The defualt
 is \ttt{false}.
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Advanced Keywords}
\begin{description}
    \item [\texttt{scaling}]\hfill \\
    If true, the atom-radii used for the cavity construction are scaled by a factor of $1.2$. This is commonly done 
    when using the \texttt{BONDI} (VdW radii) of the atoms for cavity construction. For the \ttt{UFF} radii set it is 
    adviced to turn this scaling off. The default is \ttt{true}.
    \item [\texttt{cavity}]\hfill \\
    The type of cavity used with the PCM. The default is a Delley-type cavity (\ttt{DELLEY}). Other options are 
    a primitive version of the GEPOL cavity which is available as a solvent excluded surface \ttt{GEPOL\_SES} and 
    solvent accessible surface \ttt{GEPOL\_SAS}.
    \item [\texttt{radiiType}]\hfill \\
    The atomic radii-set to be used in the cavity construction. The default is the Bondi-Mantina radii set \ttt{BONDI}.
    Note that not for all atoms radii are tabulated in this set. For the \ttt{UFF} radii set all atoms are supported.
    If the \texttt{UFF} radii set is used, it is adviced to select \ttt{scaling} as \ttt{false}.
    \item [\texttt{minDistance}]\hfill \\
    Minimum distance tolerated between surface grid points in Bohr. The default is $0.2$. This prevents singularities
    for extremely close points.
    \item [\texttt{minRadius}]\hfill \\
    Minimal radius in Bohr for additional spheres not centered on atoms (GEPOL-type surfaces only). The default is $0.377$ au.
    \item [\texttt{correction}]\hfill \\
    Correction $k$ for the apparent surface charge scaling factor in the CPCM. The default is $0.0$. In the related 
    COSMO solvation model $k$ is chosen as $0.5$. This has little effect on solvent with a high static permittivity
    but may be important for others.
    \item [\texttt{probeRadius}]\hfill \\
    Radius in Bohr of the spherical probe approximating a solvent molecule. The default is $1.0$. This is only used if
    the explicit solvent definition is used by selecting \ttt{solvent=EXPLICIT}. Otherwise the tabulated
    data is used.
    \item [\texttt{eps}]\hfill \\
    The static dielectric permittivity of the medium. The default is $1.0$. This is only used if 
    the explicit solvent definition is used by selecting \ttt{solvent=EXPLICIT}. Otherwise the tabulated
    data is used.  
    \item [\texttt{patchLevel}]\hfill \\
    Wavelet cavity mesh patch level for GEPOL cavities. The default is $0$. This increases the resoluation of the 
    GEPOL-type cavity at the intersection between spheres.
    \item [\texttt{overlapFactor}]\hfill \\
    Maximum ratio of a new sphere to be allowed to be covered within the already present ones. This is only used for 
    GEPOL-type surfaces. The default is $0.7$.  
    \item [\texttt{lLarge}]\hfill \\
    Angular momentum used for the spherical grid construction for non-hydrogen atoms for DELLEY-type surfaces. The default
    is $7$, which corresponds to 110 spherical grid points for each  non-hydrogen atom.
    \item [\texttt{lSmall}]\hfill \\
    Angular momentum used for the spherical grid construction for hydrogen atoms for DELLEY-type surfaces. The default
    is $4$, which corresponds to 50 spherical grid points for each hydrogen atom.
    \item [\texttt{alpha}]\hfill \\
    The sharpness parameter for the molecular surface model function for DELLEY-type surfaces. The default
    is $50$, which corresponds to fairly sharp surfaces. Since the model employes an exponential 
    molecular surface model function, results are relatively stable with vaiation of the parameter. The surface 
    will typically become obese for values smaller than $10$, which leads to a lowered dielectric interaction with 
    the continuum.
    \item [\texttt{projectionCutOff}]\hfill \\
    The cut-off for the projection to the molecular surface for DELLEY-type surfaces. Each atom-wise grid 
    point is projected to the molecular surface. If the molecular surface is too far away, the grid point is 
    assumed to be unimportant and covered within the molecule. The value is given in atomic units. Its default is 
    $5.0$.
    \item [\texttt{oneCavity}]\hfill \\
    Only cavity points connected to the point with the most extreme
    x-coordinate are kept after cavity construction. Two points are connected if they are within
    $connectivityFactor\times probeRadius$ from another. This can be used to eliminate cavity points within a 
    moleular cluster. The default is \ttt{false}.
    \item [\texttt{connectivityFactor}]\hfill \\
    The scaling factor for point connection. The default is $2.0$. Increase this for low
    resolution cavities. This is only used for \ttt{oneCavity=true}.
    \item [\texttt{numberDensity}]\hfill \\
    The number density (in a.u.) of the solvent. The default is $1.0$. This is only used if 
    \ttt{solvent=EXPLICIT} and \ttt{cavityFormation=true} are given.
    \item [\texttt{temperature}]\hfill \\
    The temperature used in the scaled particle theory treatment of the cavity formation. The
    default is $298.15$. This is only used if \ttt{cavityFormation=true} is given.
    \item [\texttt{cavityProbeRadius}]\hfill \\
    The probe radius used for the calculation of the cavity formation energy. The default is $5.0$.
    This is only used if \ttt{solvent=EXPLICIT} and \ttt{cavityFormation=true} are given.

\subsection{EField Block}\label{sec:system:efield}
The \ttt{EField} block contains options regarding external electric fields. Currently,
two strategies for using electric fields can be chosen. First, a molecular system is placed between 
two circular plates consisting of opposing point charges which will be referred to as numerical
electric field. The algorithm used for constructing these capacitor plates loosely resembles the
method used in TITAN~\cite{stuyver2020}.
Second the so-called analytical electric fields are produced by incorporating
dipole integrals into the Core Hamiltonian.
Parameters of this algorithm can be adjusted here.

\section{Tasks}
\label{sec:tasks}
The task block accepts different options depending on the task to be run.
These task specific options, as well as the options common to all tasks will be listed and explained
in the following section.\\
\\
The general form of a task block is the following.
Each task block is opened by a \ttt{+task} statement followed by the name of the
task to be run and is ended by a \ttt{-task} statement.\\
Furthermore each task block accepts three types of systems. Supersystem (keywords: \ttt{super}),
Active  systems (keywords: \ttt{system}, \ttt{active}, \ttt{act}) and environment systems
(\ttt{environment}, \ttt{env}) their meaning changes depending
on the task type. Additionally a print level (keywords: \ttt{printLevel}) and timings
print level (keyword: \ttt{timingsPrintLevel}) are available
for every task. The effect of the print levels will depend on the task. More information
is given in Section~\ref{sec:tasksPrintLevels}.
The exact meaning of active versus environment system will be given in this sections
for each task specifically.
A minimal task block for a SCF calculation could look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
+task scf
  system water
-task
\end{lstlisting}
Note that some tasks may use a block structure similar to the system settings.
The blocks are opened and closed in the same way as before. The input for an
FDE calculation for two water molecules with the Huzinaga operator and the
PBE functional for the exchange--correlation interaction may look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
+task FDE
  act waterA
  env waterB
  +emb
    naddXCFunc PBE
    embeddingMode HUZINAGA
  -emb
-task
\end{lstlisting}
Possible blocks are listed in the respective task documentation and their
structure shown in the following sections starting with~\ref{sec:scb:emb}.

\subsection{General Keywords}
\label{sec:tasksPrintLevels}
The following keywords are present, and can be changed in all tasks, regardless
of the other keywords present.
\begin{description}
  \item [\texttt{printLevel}]\hfill \\
Changing the print level may result in additional output which is indented by
a set of characters in order to allow for easy searches. Furthermore, the number
of eigenvalues printed to the output after converging a SCF calculation depends
on the print level.
The print levels for every task and their effects are:
\begin{table}[H]\small \centering \begin{tabular}{|>{\ttfamily}c|>{\ttfamily}c|l|}\hline
   & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Indent}&\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Number printed eigenvalues}\\\hline
  \texttt{MINIMUM}          &       & HOMO-LUMO gap    \\\hline
  \texttt{NORMAL }[Default] &       & HOMO-9 to LUMO+9 \\\hline
  \texttt{VERBOSE}          & ==V== & 0 to LUMO+9      \\\hline
  \texttt{DEBUGGING}        & ==D== & ALL              \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\item [\texttt{timingsPrintLevel}]\hfill \\
   The amount of timings that will be printed to the output. This settings is closer to a
   debug/developer setting, yet it may also be interesting for an experienced user.
   The default value is $1$, a value of $0$ will remove many timings, higer
   values than $1$ may add additional timings.
\end{description}

 \item [\texttt{linearScalingSigmaVector}]\hfill \\
 If true, the integrals required for the sigma vector construction in DLPNO-CCSD are calculated directly from
 intergrals calculated during the main integral transformation. This requires slightly more memory, however,
 the amplitude optimization is accelerated by more than one order of magnitude. Note that this scheme is an
 additional approximation. It is sensible to set this to true for larger systems. Default is \ttt{true}.

\subsection{Task: Active-Space Selection\label{sec:activeSpaceTask}}
This tasks performs an occupied orbital selection for the calculation of relative
energies along a reaction path. The atoms of all supersystems have to be identical
and ordered in the same way. If active and environment systems are provided via the
input, the results of the selection is saved in these systems. The charge, atoms, basis
set and spin may be changed. If no environment and/or active systems are provided
via the input, systems are constructed and written to disk with the names
supersystem name + ``\_act''/``\_env'' for active and environment system, respectively.
For information regarding the methodology we refer to the original publications~\cite{Bensberg2019a,Bensberg2020}.

    The atom-wise Mulliken population threshold for the assignment of atoms to the subsystems. This is done

\subsection{Task: Basis-Set Truncation\label{task:truncation}}
Performs a truncation of the basis set of the given system. Only basis functions centred
on dummy atoms are truncated. All others are considered to be the core basis of the
system. Note that this task can manipulate the geometry of the given system such that 
dummy atoms without any basis functions will not survive. This effectively truncates any associated 
fitting basis.

{\color{red}IMPORTANT:} There will be no orbitals available for the system after executing this
task! Only the density matrix is available. This task should always be followed by an SCF-like step!
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
  +task BST
    act water
    truncAlgorithm NETPOPULATION
  -task
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Basic Keywords}
\begin{description}
  \item [\texttt{name}]\hfill \\
    Aliases for this task are \ttt{BasisSetTask} and \ttt{BST}.
  \item [\texttt{activeSystems}]\hfill \\
    Will use the first active system and truncate the basis set based on the density of the given system.
  \item [\texttt{truncAlgorithm}]\hfill \\

    algorithm (\ttt{NETPOPULATION}) is taken. This algorithm eliminates basis functions from the active
    system where the sum of all squared occupied orbital coefficients is lower than \ttt{netThreshold}.
    Alternatively the primitive net-population algorithm (\ttt{PRIMITIVENETPOP}) can be requested. This
    algorithm reduces the number of basis functions by the factor \ttt{truncationFactor}.

\end{description}

\subsection{Task: Broken--Symmetry\label{task:brokensymmetry}}
The Broken--Symmetry task performs broken--symmetry (BS) calculations using KS-DFT
or sDFT. During a BS calculation, the phenomenological parameter $J_\text{AB}$ is calculated
which describes the magnetic interaction between two spin sites. The corresponding 
Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck (HDvV) Hamiltonian is:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{H}_\text{HDvV} = -2J_\text{AB} \hat{S}_\text{A} \hat{S}_\text{B}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\hat{S}$ is the spin localized on spin site A or B. A positive value of $J_{AB}$ describes
a ferromagnetically coupled system while a negative value specifies an antiferromagnetic coupling.
The BS state in a regular BS (KS)-DFT calculation is constructed from the high spin (HS) 
state via the Localized Natural Orbitals (LNO) approach\cite{shoji2014}. In case of sDFT
calculations the BS state is constructed directly from the subsystems, see also Ref. \cite{massolle2020}.

Several formalisms for the calculation of $J_{AB}$ were proposed and are implemented. In the
following they will be called $J(1)_{AB}$\cite{ginsberg1980, noodleman1981, noodleman1986},
$J(2)_{AB}$\cite{bencini1986}, $J(3)_{AB}$\cite{yamaguchi1986, soda2000} and $J(4)_{AB}$\cite{noodleman1981}. The corresponding equations are:
\begin{align}
	J(1)_{AB} &= \frac{E_\text{BS}-E_\text{HS}}{S_\text{max}^2}\\
	J(2)_{AB} &= \frac{E_\text{BS}-E_\text{HS}}{S_\text{max} (S_\text{max} +1)}\\
	J(3)_{AB} &= \frac{E_\text{BS}-E_\text{HS}}{\langle \hat{S}^2\rangle_\text{HS} - \langle \hat{S}^2\rangle_\text{BS}}\\
	J(4)_{AB} &= \frac{E_\text{BS}-E_\text{HS}}{1 + S_\text{AB}^2},
\end{align}
with $E_\text{BS}$ and $E_\text{HS}$ as the energy of the BS or HS state, $S_\text{max}$
the spin of the HS state, $\langle \hat{S}^2\rangle$ the $S^2$ expectation value and $S_\text{AB}$ the overlap
of the magnetic orbitals. $J(1)_{AB}$ describes the weak and $J(2)_{AB}$ the
strong interaction limit. $J(3)_{AB}$ and $J(4)_{AB}$ describe the whole interaction range.

Currently, it is possible to calculate (hyper) polarizabilites. Those properties can be calculated
either numerically, analytically or semi-numerically depending on the provided \ttt{frequency} keyword.
In general it is possible to calculate static and dynamic polarizabilities either numerically \ttt{frequency 0.0} or analytically \ttt{frequency 1e-9}. In the former case 12 SCF calculations will be performed varying the applied finite field.

The semi-numerical calculation of static hyperpolarizabilities may be triggered by choosing \ttt{frequency 1e-9} and \ttt{hyperpolarizability true}. Additionally, it is possible to obtain hyperpolarizabilities from the numerical differentiation
of dynamic polarizabilities with respect to a static electric field. This is possible by specifying any \ttt{frequency} and \ttt{hyperpolarizability true}.

\subsection{Task: Frozen-Density Embedding Electron Transfer}

This task calculates adiabatic wave functions from the linear combination of any number of quasi-diabatic states.
Those wave functions are used to calculate several charge-transfer properties. Within a two-state approach, the
analytical electronic coupling and  excitation energy are calculated. For multiple quasi-diabatic states, the Hamilton
matrix in the quasi-diabatic basis as well as the energy levels of the adiabatic wave functions are calculated.
Additionally, spin-density distributions can be calculated and printed to cube files. Moreover, atom-wise spin
populations via a Becke-Population analysis can be obtained. Basically, this task combines the FDE-ET and FDE-diab
formalisms. This task is only implemented for the \ttt{UNRESTRICTED} case, therefore, prior FaT calculations must also be
carried out in spin-unrestricted mode.
\subsubsection{Example Input}
\begin{lstlisting}
+task fdeet
  #quasi-diabatic state 1
  act sys1-state1
  act sys2-state1

  \item [\texttt{states}]\hfill \\
  This vector input defines the quasi-diabatic states. Herein, the number of elements in the vector defines how many
  quasi-diabatic states are used, while each index specifies the number of subsystems contained in this state. All states must have the same number 
  of systems. Here, the ordering of the \ttt{activeSystems} is important! As an example, \ttt{states\{2 2\}} specifies a linear combination of 2 quasi-diabatic states, where the first state is composed of the first two \ttt{activeSystems} and the second state is composed of the next two \ttt{activeSystems}.
  \item [\texttt{couple}]\hfill \\
  This vector input specifies which of the specified \ttt{states} shall be used in the linear combination.
  Therefore, \ttt{couple\{1 2\}} can be understood as using states 1 and 2. Additionally, \ttt{couple\{1 2 ; 1 3\}}
  can be understood as two separate FDE-ET runs for which in the first run states 1 and 2 are used, whereas in the
  second run states 1 and 3 are used. Using 3 or 4 quasi-diabatic states can be accomplished by specifying
  \ttt{couple\{1 2 3\}} or \ttt{couple\{1 2 3 4\}}, respectively.

  Specifies if the spin density of the adiabatic states shall be calculated and printed to cube file. By default \ttt{false}.
  \item [\texttt{spinpopulation}]\hfill \\

  This vector input specifies which adiabatic states are used for the population analysis if \ttt{spinpopulation true}. By default \ttt{\{0\}}. This corresponds to the calculation of the spin populations for the first adiabatic state.

  \item [\texttt{disjoint}]\hfill \\
  This vector input specifies the usage of the disjoint approximation for FDE-ET/Diab. Therefore, \ttt{disjoint \{1 2\}} corresponds to joining

  The threshold which is used for the Moore--Penrose pseudo inverse. By default \ttt{1e-3}.

  files or not. By default \ttt{false}.
  \item [\texttt{diskMode}]\hfill \\

  This is often the case when many quasi-diabatic states are coupled of which each state holds a very large transition-density matrix. By default \ttt{false}.

\subsection{Task: LRSCF (TDDFT/CC2/BSE)}
This task performs linear-response TDDFT/TDA calculations. In case of an uncoupled embedding calculation additional environment subsystems needs to be added. In order to perform a coupled calculation more than one active system needs to be specified. Note that a coupled calculation requires a previous uncoupled calculation for the respective subsystem. These capabilities exist for excitation energies, oscillator strengths, rotatory strengths and both damped and regular linear-response properties (polarizabilties, optical rotation).\\

\noindent
In Serenity version 1.4.0 the approximate second-order coupled cluster model CC2 was added. Furthermore, CIS(D), its iterative variant CIS(D$_\infty$) and
ADC(2) are available. For these methods, also transition moments from the ground state can be computed (and thus oscillator and rotatory strengths).
Additionally, Bethe--Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations with and without the TDA can be performed.

    Grid (\ttt{grid}) settings are added via sub-blocks in the task settings.

    \item [\texttt{ccprops}]\hfill \\
    If \ttt{false}, no transition moments will be calculated for CC2, CIS(D$_\infty$) and ADC(2). The default is \ttt{false}.
    \item [\texttt{frequencies}]\hfill \\

    \item [\texttt{frequencyRange}]\hfill \\

    \item [\texttt{rpaScreening}]\hfill \\
    Performs the exchange integral evaluation with static RPA screening. This keyword needs to be set to perform a BSE calculation in combination with \texttt{riCache}=\ttt{true}. The default is \ttt{false}. Note: If environmental subsystems are specified their screening contribution is included approximately. 
    \item [\texttt{restart}]\hfill \\
    Tries restarting from (preferably converged) eigenpairs that the tasks
    looks for in the system folder.
    \item [\texttt{triplet}]\hfill \\
    Used for triplet excitations. The default ist \ttt{false}.
    \item [\texttt{scfstab}]\hfill \\
    Used for SCF wavefunction stability analysis. Defaults to \ttt{NONE}. Available are
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Real RHF $\rightarrow$ Real RHF    : $(A+B)$, singlet \ttt{scfstab real} (internal)
      \item Real RHF $\rightarrow$ Real UHF    : $(A+B)$, triplet \ttt{scfstab real} and \ttt{triplet true} (external)
      \item Real RHF $\rightarrow$ Complex RHF : $(A-B)$, singlet \ttt{scfstab nonreal} (external)
      \item Real UHF $\rightarrow$ Real UHF    : $(A+B)$ \ttt{scfstab real} (internal)

      \item Spin-Flip TD-HF/DFT \ttt{scfstab spinflip} (performed within the TDA)
    \end{itemize}
    The goal of an SCF is to minimize the energy with respect to orbital variation. At convergence of an SCF, the electronic gradient vanishes,
    i.e. $F_{ia} = 0$ corresponding to a stationary point. A sufficient condition for this stationary point to be a true minimum is that the matrix of 
    second derivatives with respect to to orbital variation (called the stability matrix) is positive definite. If it is not, there exist orbital rotations
    between occupied and virtual orbitals that further minimze the energy. A stability analysis diagonalizes the stability matrix and can be used
    to follow specific eigenvectors pointing towards the corresponding lower energy solution.
    One differentiates between internal (keeping the constraints of the original SCF wavefunction) and external (lifting certain constraints of the original SCF wavefunction) stability analyses.
    The [Real RHF $\rightarrow$ Real UHF] stability analysis (arguably most common), for example, can be used to identify triplet instabilities, i.e. finds
    if there exists a lower triplet (UHF) wavefunction than the found singlet (RHF) one. Spin-Flip TDDFT is not a stability analysis, but was
    implemented alongside them so it appears here for the sake of computational simplicity.
    \item [\texttt{stabroot}]\hfill \\
    Instruct to rotate the orbitals along the direction devised by the instability indexed by stabroot (usually 1, i.e. the lowest).

\subsection{Task: SCF}
This task solves the Roothaan--Hall equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:roothaan-hall}) for one single system.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:roothaan-hall}
\textbf{F}\textbf{C} =  \textbf{S}\textbf{C}\varepsilon
\end{equation}
Here $\textbf{F}$ is the Fock matrix which is the matrix representation of the Fock operator $\hat{F}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fockop}
\hat{F} = \hat{T}_{\text{e}} + \hat{V}_{\text{ne}} + \hat{J} + \hat{V}_{\text{xc}}~,
\end{equation}
$\textbf{S}$ is the atom orbital (AO) overlap matrix, with the elements:
\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = \langle \chi_i(r) | \chi_j(r) \rangle= \int \chi_i(r) \chi^*_j(r) ~\text{d}r,
\end{equation}
$\textbf{C}$ is the coefficient matrix containing the the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) of
each molecular orbital (MO):
\begin{equation}
\phi_i(r) = \sum_j C_{ij} \cdot \chi_j(r)~,
\end{equation}
and $\varepsilon$ is a diagonal matrix containing the orbital energies.
$\textbf{F}$ can be the (Hartree--)Fock matrix ($\hat{V}_{\text{xc}} = \hat{K}$) and also the Kohn--Sham Fock matrix ($V_{\text{xc}}[\rho(r),\nabla\rho(r),...]$), depending on the method chosen
in the \ttt{system} block of the given active system.
The iterative SCF procedure consists of three main steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Construction of $\textbf{F}$ from the electron density ($\textbf{P}$,$\rho(r)$)
	\item Generation of new orbitals by solving of Eq.~\ref{eq:roothaan-hall} for $\textbf{C}$
	\item The calculation of the electron density ($\textbf{D}$,$\rho(r)$) from the orbitals, using a given occupation.
\end{itemize}
Convergence of the SCF procedure is accelerated using DIIS\cite{pula1982} and damping by default.
In addition to the default settings it is also possible to switch the DIIS\cite{pula1982} for the ADIIS\cite{hu2010},
and it is possible to modify the way the damping is applied, and also its strength.
In the case of SCF calculations that do not converge easily it usually helps to simply increase the amount of damping that is
applied.
The ultimately best strategy may however vary with the given system.
For all options pertaining the convergence please see the \ttt{scf} block options of the systems, Section~\ref{sec:system:scf}.

\subsection{Task: System-Splitting}
The System-Splitting Task splits the occupied orbital set of a supersystem into subsets which are associated with fragments of the supersystem. The number of fragments is not limited, however, the union of all subsystem atoms have to give the supersystem atoms. Atoms are not allowed to be duplicated in the subsystems. The partitioning is based on the orbital localization. Basis-set changes are allowed. If the basis set of a sub- and the supersystem do not match, the density matrix of the subsystem is constructed by projecting the density matrix corresponding to the selected orbitals into the subsystem basis. Charge, spin and geometry of
the subsystems may be changed.

\subsection{Task: Top-Down Embedding\label{sec:topDownTask}}
The Top-Down Embedding Task (also named the Projection-Based Embedding Task in prior versions),
is on of the two major embedding Tasks in \textsc{Serenity}. It only works with two subsystems, one being the active system (containing all atoms to be in the active region), the second one being the environment system (containing all other atoms). The 'top-down' labeling references the fact that at first a supersystem calculation is carried out. Subsequently, the two actual subsystems are identified by distribution of the orbital space into an active and an environment part. The active system is then relaxed using the specified active system method, while the environment system is kept frozen.\\ The initial supersystem calculation is carried out using the settings of the environment system, expecting these settings to result in a setup that is computationally cheaper, in general. Note that the basis set requested in the environment system is used for all atoms of the supersystem in this calculation. This ensures the evenly tempered distribution of the electron density across the entire supersystem, which is beneficial for a reasonable distribution of orbitals into active and environment regions. This distribution usually happens after a localization procedure. All of the settings for both, orbital localization and distribution into subsystems are given below. Furthermore, it is possible to truncate the basis of the active system in several different ways, which are also given below. This feature allows for the embedded active system calculation to be faster than a supersystem calculation with the same settings. \\Note that the Top-Down Embedding Task is identical to calling the following input, with exception for
potential-reconstruction techniques:
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
name supersystem
...
-system

+system
name active
...
-system

+system

-system

+task ADD
act supersystem
env active

#May be set to true to produce an initial guess for the 
#supersystem from subsystem densities.

\chapter{Python Input}
Serenity features a Python wrapper.
The wrapper is written with \textsc{pybind11}\cite{pybind11} and should allow for an easy access of \serenity s functionality from Python.
The wrapper is named serenipy and comes in the form of a shared library named libserenipy.so .

This library can directly be imported into Python with ether of the following lines:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import serenipy
from serenipy import *
\end{lstlisting}
While this manual contains a rough outline of the functionality of the Python wrapper the doc-strings can be accessed via the
\texttt{help()} function of Python. For example :
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import serenipy
help(serenipy)
\end{lstlisting}
This will display the automated documentation including both the links to C++ generated by \textsc{pybind11} and the additionally written doc-strings.
\section{Wrapped Systems and Settings}
A system inside the wrapper is generated for a set of \ttt{Settings},
the settings are essentially the same as described in Section~\ref{sec:system}.
Each block is a member of the settings and each keyword is a member of the block.
A small example of altering the settings can look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import serenipy as spy

settings = spy.Settings()
settings.basis.label = 'def2-TZVP'
settings.name = 'Hans'
settings.dft.functional = spy.PBE0
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Wrapped Tasks}
Most of the tasks in that exist in Serenity should be wrapped and also exist as classes inside the Python wrapper.
They can be build by constructing a task object with a given set of systems.
The amount of systems (active and environment) accepted can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:tasks}.
Afterwords the tasks settings can be accessed via the task object, exactly like the normal settings.
There is one special thing to note, while the tasks in general have the same names as in the C++ code, or the
normal input, the specification of a restricted or unrestricted task has to be given via the object name.
Restricted tasks are called \ttt{<usual-task-name>\_R} and unrestricted ones \ttt{<usual-task-name>\_U}.
This is due to the fact that restricted and unrestricted tasks are actually different classes, because they are templates.
Here a minimal example for a SCF calculation with all default settings:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from serenipy import *

settings = Settings()
settings.geometry = "test.xyz"
system = System(settings)
task = ScfTask_R(system)
task.run()
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Other Wrapper Features}
In addition to the tasks, systems and settings other important classes of \serenity are exposed to Python.
For example it is possible to get the results of a gradient calculation and also specific energies.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from serenipy import *
import numpy as np
...
gradients = system.getGeometry().getGradients()
print(gradients)
print(system.getEnergy())
print(system.getEnergy(KS_DFT_ELECTRON_ELECTRON_EXCHANGE))
\end{lstlisting}
All matrices mapped to numpy.arrays.
It and a density matrix can as an example can be accessed as:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
dMat = system.getElectronicStructure_R().getDensityMatrix()
print(dMat.total())
\end{lstlisting}
Furthermore, it is possible to access Libint as integrated into the C++ library.
Using the AO overlap as an example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
libint = Libint()
S_AO = libint.compute(OVERLAP, system.getBasis())
print(S_AO)
\end{lstlisting}
If you want to use additional features via python please use the \ttt{help()} function to explore the package
and or write an e-mail to one of the developers.

\newpage
\chapter{Bugs, Feedback and Feature Requests}
Bug reports and feature requests for the \serenity code can and should be communicated \textit{via} the issue tracker included in the
repository. Please open issues for features requests and bugs, only after checking if the same issue or feature has already been requested/reported.
Both features requests and bugs can be labeled as such within the issue tracking system.\\
\\
In the case of bug reports and problems the developers are most likely to answer to these issues, as they are logged and will also help for future questions, because they
are archived. \\
\\
Feature requests will be open for discussion and if they are popular or small enough they likely be added to the code.
For this reason please keep features requests simple or add tasks to them so it is simple to see and discuss the missing pieces and spot
synergies with other projects.
(Of cause it is also possible to provide a pull/merge request and contribute a specific feature to the code yourself.)\\
\\
In the case of general feedback and questions or specific comments about the manual's text feel free to contact the developers or authors directly.

\chapter{Example Inputs}
\section{Standard SCF}
The first example is a minimal input for a restricted HF single point calculation.
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method hf
-system

+task scf
  act watera
-task
\end{lstlisting}
For systems with a spin not equal to zero the calculation will automatically be run in the \ttt{unrestricted} mode
as in the U-KS-DFT example below.
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method dft
  spin 1
  charge -1
  +dft
    functional pbe0
  -dft
  +basis
    label def2-TZVP
  -basis
-system

+task scf
  act watera
-task
\end{lstlisting}
For systems with a spin equal to zero the unrestricted mode can be forced, using the appropriate keyword,
as in the final example of this section:
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method dft
  scfmode unrestricted
  +dft
    functional pbe0

  -basis
-system

+task scf
  act watera

\end{lstlisting}
A continuum solvation model can be enabled by changing the flag 'use' in the PCM-block to true:
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method dft
  scfmode restricted

\section{Coupled Cluster Calculation}
This example shows how to perform a (frozen core) DLPNO-CCSD calculation:

\section{Geometry Optimization}
This example shows how to optimize a structure using DFT:

    functional PBE
    dispersion d3bjabc

\end{lstlisting}
in case of a sDFT optimization extra sDFT options (\ttt{naddXCFunc},\ttt{naddKinFunc}) and the names of the other system(s) (\ttt{waterb}) have to be added.
\begin{lstlisting}

\section{Hessian Calculation}
This example shows how to calculate a (sermi-numerical) Hessian using DFT:

  method dft
  +dft
    functional PBE
    dispersion d3bjabc
  -dft
-system

\end{lstlisting}
in case of a sDFT run extra sDFT options (\ttt{naddXCFunc}, \ttt{naddKinFunc}) and the names of the other system(s) (\ttt{waterb}) have to be added.
\begin{lstlisting}

\section{Frozen Density Embedding (FDE)}
A minimal input of a DFT calculation embedded in the frozen density of another system.
The environment system will be calculated in an isolated manner implicitly.
The basis is kept to be the default. Note that it is in principle also possible to have
both system run using Hartree--Fock and only the interaction \textit{via} FDE.
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method dft

  act watera
  env waterb
  +EMB
    naddxcfunc pw91
    naddkinfunc pw91k
  -EMB
-task
\end{lstlisting}
A continuum solvation model enclosing all subsystems can be used by setting 'use' to true
in the task specific PCM-block. Note that any PCM-settings set for any subsystem are ignored
in the embedding step of all FDE-type calculations. However, they will affect the isolated
SCF calculations for the subsystems.
\begin{lstlisting}

\section{Freeze-and-Thaw (FaT/sDFT)}
A minimal input for a \textit{freeze-and-thaw} (FaT/sDFT) calculation.
In addition to the two given systems which will be iterated over until
convergence, additional \ttt{environment} systems can be added, which will never
be relaxed. More \ttt{active} systems are also possible, of cause.
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method dft
  +dft
    functional pw91

  act waterb
  convThresh 1e-6
  +EMB
    naddxcfunc pw91
    naddkinfunc pw91k
  -EMB
-task
\end{lstlisting}
A continuum solvation model enclosing all subsystems can be used in the same way as for
FDE.

\section{MP2-in-DFT Embedding via Projection}
The following example will combine the two given fragments/subsystems into one bigger supersystem, and optimize its orbitals using
the settings of the environment system (KS-DFT). Afterward the orbitals will be localized and the active system will be picked,
then the active system will be optimized (using HF), while embedded within the environment orbitals \textit{via} projection based embedding.
Finally, the altered active system energy will be corrected using RI-MP2. Note that this example does not include a basis set truncation within
the projection-based embedding part.
\begin{lstlisting}
+system
  name watera
  geometry watera.xyz
  method HF

+system
  name waterb
  geometry waterb.xyz

\end{lstlisting}
A continuum solvation model enclosing both subsystems can be used in the same way as for
FDE.

\section{Direct Orbital Selection-based DLPNO-CCSD(T$_0$)-in-DFT Embedding via the Huzinaga Equation}
This example performs Direct Orbital Selection (DOS)-based DLPNO-CCSD(T$_0$)-in-DFT calculations for two points
(reactant and transiton state) along a reaction coordinate. First the active orbital space for the two systems
is selected using the ActiveSpaceSelectionTask. Then the embedded calculations are performed in which the subsystem
orbitals are constrained to stay orthogonal using the shifted Huzinaga equation. Finally, the local coupled cluster
calculations are done for the active systems embedded into their respective environments.

\section{Potential Reconstruction (OEP)}
The following example input will run a freeze-and-thaw calculation employing accurate non-additive kinetic potentials generated using
potential reconstruction techniques (\ttt{embeddingmode reconstruction}). It will choose what we call to Bottom-Up approach (\cite{good2010}) (as it is the Freeze and Thaw Task).
However, the Top-Down approach (\cite{fux2010}) is also available (by choosing the TDEmbedding Task). A supersystem basis is used throughout
the freeze-and-thaw calculation (extendBasis true, basisExtThresh -1) in order to generate accurate total densities $\rho^\mathrm{tot}(\vec{r})$. During
the Wu--Yang potential reconstruction (\cite{wu2003}), the potential will be expressed in the def2-QZVP (\cite{weig2005}) basis. A pseudo inversion of the Hessian
will be performed, neglecting eigenvalues lower than $|\text{max. eigenvalue}|\cdot 10^{-5}$ ( \ttt{singValThreshold 1e-5}). Furthermore, in order to generate
physically meaningful potentials, a constraint as proposed in Ref. (\cite{heat2007}) is employed ( \ttt{smoothFactor 1e-3}).

\chapter{Short History of Serenity Until the First Release}

The work on \serenity started originally as a hobby project
by Thomas Dresselhaus (TD). The first
documented commit by TD, at the time a PhD student in the group of
Johannes Neugebauer (JN), is from March 24, 2013. During 2013,
TD extended this project into a restricted HF-SCF code
(working with up to $d$-functions).\\
\\
Accompanied by continuous discussions with and support from the
research group head (JN), the project gained
momentum in 2014. During a first hackathon with TD, Jan Unsleber (JU),
and Dennis Barton (DB) in January 2014, the code was extended to a
restricted DFT program. In fall 2014, when the working title of the
project was already changed to Serenity, TD (and JU) initiated a
\serenity Seminar in the Neugebauer group, in which further work
on the program was discussed and planned. Also about this time,
first \serenity-related projects were integrated into PhD projects
in the Neugebauer group.\\
\\
With Kevin Klahr (KK, 02/2015), David Schnieders (DS, 11/2015), and Michael
Boeckers (MB, 02/2016), three more PhD students joined the SereniTEAM and
the program developed into a multipurpose embedding code.
The program, which received its official release name in March 2015, and
which was moved to a Git repository on a self-hosted GitLab server in
November 2015, reached a status that allowed to use it as a coding
platform for Bachelor and Master thesis work in early 2016. By 11/2017,
10 BSc theses and 6 MSc research projects/theses had employed it as
a code basis.\\
\\
In the course of 2016, JU effectively evolved into TD's successor as the
lead developer of the code and shaped its current structure. He also
coordinated the work towards the first release version, which was mainly
planned by himself, TD, and the group head (JN) from fall 2016 onwards.
The first release candidate of Serenity could be distributed to specific
testers in 2017. The release of version 1.0.0 took place in December 2017.

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\addtocounter{enumi}{-1}  % start at 0

\item Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, ``this License'' refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the ``GNU GPL'' refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  ``The Library'' refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An ``Application'' is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A ``Combined Work'' is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the ``Linked
Version''.

  The ``Minimal Corresponding Source'' for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The ``Corresponding Application Code'' for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

\item Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

\item Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   \item under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.
   \end{enumerate}

\item Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   \item Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
   \end{enumerate}

\item Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   \item Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   \item For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   \item Do one of the following:

       \begin{enumerate}
       \addtocounter{enumiii}{-1}  % start at 0
       \item Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       \item Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.
       \end{enumerate}

   \item Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
   \end{enumerate}

\item Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   \item Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   \end{enumerate}

\item Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License ``or any later version''
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
